							Wattuwer is a clothing and accesories brand. We originated in the Philippines.
							We're one of the fastest growing clothing company in Asia. Currently we have
							20 branches in the Philippines. Lift your head, baby don't be scared. On the
							things that could go wrong along the way. You'll get by, with a smile, you
							can't win at everything but you can try. Baby, you don't have to worry cause there ain't no need to hurry. No one ever said that there's a easy way.
							When they're closing all their doors, and they don't want you anymore, this 
							sounds funny but I'll say it anyway. Girl I'll stay through the bad times, even if i have to fetch you everyday. We'll get by, with a smile. You can never be too happy in this life. Cause in a world where everybody hates
							a happy ending story, it's a wonder love can make the world go round. But don't let it bring you down, or turn your face into a frown, you'll get along with a little prayer and a song.
